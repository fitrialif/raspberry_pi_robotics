Some random stuff for raspi self driving car

# startup.py

The car doesn't have a display, so it needs to e-mail me to tell me it's IP so I can SSH into it

# secret.py

This repo depends on you adding a secret.py file to the folder. This file should contain these three variables, filled out with your credentials. I suggest using an app password for google:
gmail_user = ""
gmail_pwd = ""
master_email = ''
